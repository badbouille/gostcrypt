# Script to generate the volumes in the directory

# Note:
# Normally, the volumes should be created by-hand, to ensure the program is conform to the standard
# In reality, it is impossible to create by hand a perfect volume.
# The unit tests already are there to make sure the underlying functions (Volumes, Algorithms, ..) works as specified.

# The volumes are generated from a stable version of the program and supposed to be analysed by hand (make sure the
# actual volumes make sense. These volumes are added in git as a regression test, to make sure the stable old volumes
# still works as intended. The script is only intended for easier update of theses volumes
