# Script to test volume mount capability of gostcrypt

# Steps:
# - Call the createReference.sh script to create all types of volumes.
#    - if the command fails, program does not conform
# - Volumes are never constant and can not be compared to reference volumes
# - xmount.sh is ran over our new volumes

# update path if needed
